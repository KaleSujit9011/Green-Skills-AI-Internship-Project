# Green-Skills AI Internship Project  
## Path-Dependent Energy Stress Modeling for Lithium-Ion Battery Packs

An end-to-end, research-grade AI framework that models lithium-ion battery
degradation as a **path-dependent functional learning problem**, moving
beyond traditional cycle-counting and energy-throughput approaches.

This repository integrates **data science, machine learning, functional deep
learning (DeepONet), explainability, and AI-driven analytics** to quantify
battery stress based on *how* energy flows through a battery—not just how
much.

---

## 🔬 Project Motivation

Traditional battery aging models assume:

> Same energy throughput ⇒ Same degradation

This assumption is fundamentally flawed.

**Same Ah ≠ Same Damage**

High-frequency current fluctuations, sharp spikes, and pulsed loads degrade
batteries faster—even when total energy usage is identical.

This project introduces a **Stress Functional Learning Framework** that:

- Learns degradation directly from current waveforms
- Captures path dependence in battery aging
- Identifies toxic load shapes
- Predicts capacity fade and remaining useful life
- Constructs a Safe vs Dangerous operating envelope

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Replace cycle counting with stress-based degradation modeling
- Learn degradation physics directly from data
- Capture path dependence in lithium-ion aging
- Combine ML, Deep Learning, and physics-informed constraints
- Deliver interpretable insights for Battery Management Systems (BMS)

---

## 🧠 Core Concept: Stress as a Functional

Battery degradation is modeled as a functional:

\[
D[I(t)] = \int f(I(t), \frac{dI}{dt}) \, dt
\]

Where:

- **I(t)** → current profile  
- **dI/dt** → current rate (stress amplifier)  
- **D** → learned degradation / stress  

This replaces heuristic degradation models with **data-driven physics learning**.

Each module maps directly to a conceptual block in the modeling pipeline.

## 📊 Dataset Description

### Real Battery Data (EV Lab)

Collected from a battery test bench:

- Current (A)
- Voltage (V)
- Temperature (°C)
- Capacity (Ah)
- Time (timestamps)
- Cycle number
- Charge / Discharge state

### Synthetic Data (Fallback)

Used when real data is incomplete:

- Sinusoidal loads
- Pulsed current profiles
- High-frequency noisy loads
- Realistic EV driving patterns

---

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing

- Missing value handling
- Time-series resampling
- Cycle segmentation
- Numerical differentiation (dI/dt)
- Normalization & scaling
- Capacity drop computation

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering: Load Shape Toxicity

Each cycle is summarized using four physically meaningful coefficients:

| Feature | Definition | Interpretation |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| C1 | mean(I) | Average stress level |
| C2 | mean(dI/dt) | Spike-induced damage |
| C3 | std(I) | Oscillation amplitude |
| C4 | mean(I²) | Energy-weighted stress |

These features power both ML models and interpretability analysis.

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Correlation heatmaps
- Stress vs capacity plots
- Cycle-wise degradation trends
- Cluster visualization of load shapes

**Key Insight:**  
Current derivative (dI/dt) correlates more strongly with degradation than
energy throughput alone.

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### Regression (Capacity Fade Prediction)

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

### Unsupervised Learning

- KMeans clustering
- Pattern discovery in load shapes

---

## 🧬 Deep Learning: Neural Operator (DeepONet)

### Why DeepONet?

DeepONet is designed for **Function → Scalar mappings**, which exactly matches:

\[
I(t) \rightarrow \text{Stress / Degradation}
\]

### Architecture

- **Branch Network**: Learns waveform & derivative behavior
- **Trunk Network**: Learns time dependence
- Elementwise product + summation

### Physics-Informed Loss

\[
\mathcal{L} = \text{MSE} + \lambda \cdot \mathbb{E}[(dI/dt)^2]
\]

This enforces:
- Smoothness
- Physical plausibility
- Numerical stability

---

## 🛡 Stress & Safety Modeling

For each cycle:

- Stress value is predicted
- Equivalent Stress Cycles (ESC) computed
- Cycles classified as:
  - **Safe**
  - **Dangerous**

Thresholds use percentile-based stress limits.

---

## 💬 AI Chatbot Interface

A lightweight analytics chatbot enables natural-language queries:

Examples:
- “What is the mean stress?”
- “Which cycles are dangerous?”
- “Show stress vs capacity plot”
- “Cluster-wise statistics”

Demonstrates AI-powered battery analytics.
