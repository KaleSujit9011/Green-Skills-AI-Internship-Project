# 🔋 Path-Dependent Energy Stress Modeling for Lithium-Ion Battery Packs

An **end-to-end, research-grade AI project** that models **battery degradation as a path-dependent functional problem**, moving beyond traditional cycle-counting approaches.

This repository integrates **data science, machine learning, functional deep learning (DeepONet), and AI-driven analytics** to quantify battery stress based on **current waveform shape**, not just energy usage.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional battery aging models assume degradation depends on *how much* energy flows through a battery. In reality, degradation depends on *how* energy flows **over time**.

> ⚠️ Same Ah ≠ Same Damage

High-frequency current fluctuations, spikes, and pulsed loads degrade batteries faster—even when total energy is identical.

This project introduces a **Stress Functional Learning Framework** that:

* Learns degradation directly from **I(t)** and **dI/dt**
* Identifies **toxic load shapes**
* Predicts **capacity fade and stress per cycle**
* Creates a **Safe vs Dangerous operating envelope**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Replace **cycle counting** with **stress-based degradation modeling**
* Learn degradation physics directly from data
* Capture **path dependence** in battery aging
* Combine **ML + Deep Learning + Physics constraints**
* Provide **interpretable insights** for Battery Management Systems (BMS)

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

Battery degradation is modeled as a **functional**:

```
D[I(t)] = ∫ f(I(t), dI/dt) dt
```

Where:

* `I(t)` = current profile
* `dI/dt` = current derivative (stress amplifier)
* `D` = learned degradation / stress

This replaces heuristic models with **data-driven physics learning**.

## 🧪 Feature Engineering (Load Shape Toxicity)

Each cycle is summarized using **four physically meaningful coefficients**:

| Feature | Description | Interpretation         |   |                            |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | - | -------------------------- |
| C1      | mean(       | I                      | ) | Average stress level       |
| C2      | mean(       | dI/dt                  | ) | Spike / fluctuation damage |
| C3      | std(I)      | Oscillation amplitude  |   |                            |
| C4      | sum(I²)/N   | Energy-weighted stress |   |                            |

These features feed ML models and support interpretability.

Performed analyses include:

* Correlation heatmaps
* Stress vs capacity plots
* Cycle-wise degradation trends
* Cluster visualization

### Key Insight:

> `dI/dt` correlates **more strongly** with degradation than energy throughput alone.

## 🧬 Deep Learning: Neural Operator (DeepONet)

### Why DeepONet?

DeepONet is designed for:

> **Function → Scalar mappings**

Exactly matching our problem:

```
I(t) → Stress / Degradation
```

### Architecture

* **Branch Network**: Learns current & derivative behavior
* **Trunk Network**: Learns time dependence
* **Elementwise product** + summation

### Physics-Informed Loss

```
Loss = MSE + λ · mean((dI/dt)²)
```

Ensures:

* Smoothness
* Physical plausibility
* Stability

## ⚡ Stress & Safety Modeling

For each cycle:

* Stress value is predicted
* Equivalent Stress Cycle (ESC) is computed
* Cycles are classified as:

  * ✅ Safe
  * ⚠️ Dangerous

Thresholding uses percentile-based stress limits.
